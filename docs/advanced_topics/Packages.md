## Background C and C++

How it is done in C and C++ 98 and modern C++

## New syntax cppfront

Shows how is done now


## How is the code transpiled


## Advanced topics

Cover other advanced modern C++ topics (e.g. C++ 17, 20, 23) because the idea is to teach how to write code right.
If cppfront does not have a specific syntax, then use modern C++.

# TODO
Review that std is automatic include, see options of `cppfront` command to include automatic

How to create include in Cppfront, new extention (hpp2?)

How to organize files.

Maybe, talk about how to transform an old c++ project  (files and folders) to Cppfront. Maybe a strategy of convert only one c++ file at each time.
