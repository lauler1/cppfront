## Background C and C++

Embrace the convenience of type inference in Cppfront with `auto`, allowing the compiler to deduce the type of a variable from its initializer. Explore `decltype` for obtaining the type of an expression, streamlining template code, and making your programs more adaptable to changes.

	* decltype
	

## New syntax cppfront

Shows how is done now


## How is the code transpiled

## Advanced topics

Cover other advanced modern C++ topics (e.g. C++ 17, 20, 23) because the idea is to teach how to write code right.
If cppfront does not have a specific syntax, then use modern C++.
