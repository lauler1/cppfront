## Background C and C++

Operators are the verbs of the programming language, enabling you to perform actions on your data. We will cover the assignment operator for setting values, arithmetic operators for mathematical operations, compound operators for combined assignment and arithmetic, and increment/decrement operators for adjusting values succinctly.

	* Assign
	* Arithmetic
	* Compound OperatorsI
	* Increment Decrement

How it is done in C and C++ 98 and modern C++

## New syntax cppfront

Shows how is done now


## How is the code transpiled

## Advanced topics

Cover other advanced modern C++ topics (e.g. C++ 17, 20, 23) because the idea is to teach how to write code right.
If cppfront does not have a specific syntax, then use modern C++.
