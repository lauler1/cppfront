## Background C and C++

Strings are a fundamental aspect of any programming language, and Cppfront offers robust support for them. Learn about the different string types available and how to perform common operations such as concatenation and comparison. Discover Cppfront's string formatting capabilities, enabling you to integrate variables into strings seamlessly for output and logging.

How it is done in C and C++ 98 and modern C++

## New syntax cppfront

Shows how is done now


## How is the code transpiled

## Advanced topics

Cover other advanced modern C++ topics (e.g. C++ 17, 20, 23) because the idea is to teach how to write code right.
If cppfront does not have a specific syntax, then use modern C++.
