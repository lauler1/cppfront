## Background C and C++

Gain clarity on the process of introducing variables into your Cppfront code. Learn the difference between defining a variable, which allocates storage, and declaring a variable, which introduces a name into the program. Understand the importance of initialization and explore the various ways to initialize variables in Cppfront, including pointers, `nullptr`, and `const` qualifiers. Dive into the significance of compile-time initialization with `constexpr` and `consteval`.

	* pointer
	* nullpter
	* const
	* constexpr and consteval

How it is done in C and C++ 98 and modern C++

## New syntax cppfront

Shows how is done now


## How is the code transpiled

## Advanced topics

Cover other advanced modern C++ topics (e.g. C++ 17, 20, 23) because the idea is to teach how to write code right.
If cppfront does not have a specific syntax, then use modern C++.
